# Day 24: Blizzard basin

## Solution

Todays solution requires some prep!

### Reading in the file
Reading the map is easy... as it is a simple grid

```perl
my($t,$n,@q,@G,%cache) = (0,0,[1,1,0,0]);
my @M = map {chomp; [split//] } <>;
```

### Making maps.
We now need to create a series of maps... 

As the state of blizzard repeats itself both vertically and horizontally - to make the
code for part 2 easier - we can produce a "blizzard map" through - for each time point
we make a map of the blizzard locations, until we return to the original state. We get
this interval from the greatest common multiple of the height/width or the area.

```perl
my($R,@d) = ( (my $H = (@M-2))*(my $W = @{$M[0]}-2), [1,0],[0,1],[0,0],[-1,0],[0,-1] );

my($g,$h)=$H>$W?($H,$W):($W,$H); ($g,$h)=($h,$g) if $h>$g; ($g,$h)=($h,$g%$h) while $h;
$R/=$g;
```
We then create the maps. We put the borders in & two extra little borders behind the
entrance and exit {stops you walking out of the area.}
We then look for blizzards and mark the location of the blizzard in each of the maps.

This makes the next stage easier...

```perl
for my $l (0..$R-1) {
  $G[$l][$_][0]= $G[$l][$_][$W+1]=1 for 2..$H+1;
  $G[$l][0   ] = [1,1,1];
  $G[$l][1   ] = [1,0,(1)x$W];
  $G[$l][$H+2] = [(1)x$W,0,1];
  $G[$l][$H+3][$W+$_] = 1 for -1..1
}

## Now we fill each map with blizzards...
for my $y (1..$H) {
  for my $x (1..$W) {
       if( $M[$y][$x] eq '>' ) { $G[$_][$y+1][($x+$_-1)%$W+1] = 1 for 0..$R-1 }
    elsif( $M[$y][$x] eq '<' ) { $G[$_][$y+1][($x-$_-1)%$W+1] = 1 for 0..$R-1 }
    elsif( $M[$y][$x] eq '^' ) { $G[$_][($y-$_-1)%$H+2][$x]   = 1 for 0..$R-1 }
    elsif( $M[$y][$x] eq 'v' ) { $G[$_][($y+$_-1)%$H+2][$x]   = 1 for 0..$R-1 }
  }
}
```

### Walk the walk

We use a BFS to walk the walk - that means the first time we solve each puzzle it is the
best solution. We start at the entrance to the cave and try walking in the neigbouring
locations (or waiting if we can). Here we use our maps - at step "\n\" we use map "\n+1\"
(with wrap around), and keep a state - `0` if on route from start to finish, `1` on route
back to pick up sandwiches, `2` on route back to the end.

Because we have pre-computed the maps the next stage is trivial.

Finally we cache status as we can reach the same point at the same time via a number of
different route...

```perl
while(my $e = shift @q) {
  my($y,$x,$T,$flag) = @{$e};
  next if $cache{ join '-', $y, $x, (my $i=($T+1)%$R), $flag }++;
  if( $y<2 ) {                ## If we are in the starting space (top left)
    $flag = 2 if $flag == 1   ## If we have last been to the end square - pick up
                              ## the lunch
  } elsif( $y>$H+1 && $flag != 1) {          ## If we are bottom right (end square)
    $flag?($t=$T,last):($n||=$T,$flag=1)     ## and we are not returning for the lunch
                                             ## If it is 2nd visit finish!
                                             ## If it is the first visit ever tag time.
  }
  $G[$i][$y+$_->[0]][$x+$_->[1]] || push @q,[$y+$_->[0],$x+$_->[1],$T+1,$flag] for @d
                              ## Try all possible moves.
}

## Output results..
say "$n\n$t";
```

## Description

With everything replanted for next year (and with elephants and monkeys to tend the grove), you and the Elves leave for the extraction point.

Partway up the mountain that shields the grove is a flat, open area that serves as the extraction point. It's a bit of a climb, but nothing the expedition can't handle.

At least, that would normally be true; now that the mountain is covered in snow, things have become more difficult than the Elves are used to.

As the expedition reaches a valley that must be traversed to reach the extraction site, you find that strong, turbulent winds are pushing small blizzards of snow and sharp ice around the valley. It's a good thing everyone packed warm clothes! To make it across safely, you'll need to find a way to avoid them.

Fortunately, it's easy to see all of this from the entrance to the valley, so you make a map of the valley and the blizzards (your puzzle input). For example:

```
#.#####
#.....#
#>....#
#.....#
#...v.#
#.....#
#####.#
```

The walls of the valley are drawn as #; everything else is ground. Clear ground - where there is currently no blizzard - is drawn as .. Otherwise, blizzards are drawn with an arrow indicating their direction of motion: up (`^`), down (`v`), left (`<`), or right (`>`).

The above map includes two blizzards, one moving right (`>`) and one moving down (`v`). In one minute, each blizzard moves one position in the direction it is pointing:

```
#.#####
#.....#
#.>...#
#.....#
#.....#
#...v.#
#####.#
```
Due to conservation of blizzard energy, as a blizzard reaches the wall of the valley, a new blizzard forms on the opposite side of the valley moving in the same direction. After another minute, the bottom downward-moving blizzard has been replaced with a new downward-moving blizzard at the top of the valley instead:

```
#.#####
#...v.#
#..>..#
#.....#
#.....#
#.....#
#####.#
```

Because blizzards are made of tiny snowflakes, they pass right through each other. After another minute, both blizzards temporarily occupy the same position, marked 2:

```
#.#####
#.....#
#...2.#
#.....#
#.....#
#.....#
#####.#
```
After another minute, the situation resolves itself, giving each blizzard back its personal space:

```
#.#####
#.....#
#....>#
#...v.#
#.....#
#.....#
#####.#
```
Finally, after yet another minute, the rightward-facing blizzard on the right is replaced with a new one on the left facing the same direction:

```
#.#####
#.....#
#>....#
#.....#
#...v.#
#.....#
#####.#
```
This process repeats at least as long as you are observing it, but probably forever.

Here is a more complex example:

```
#.######
#>>.<^<#
#.<..<<#
#>v.><>#
#<^v^^>#
######.#
```
Your expedition begins in the only non-wall position in the top row and needs to reach the only non-wall position in the bottom row. On each minute, you can move up, down, left, or right, or you can wait in place. You and the blizzards act simultaneously, and you cannot share a position with a blizzard.

In the above example, the fastest way to reach your goal requires 18 steps. Drawing the position of the expedition as E, one way to achieve this is:

```

What is the fewest number of minutes required to avoid the blizzards and reach the goal?

Your puzzle answer was `290`.

## Part 2

As the expedition reaches the far side of the valley, one of the Elves looks especially dismayed:

He forgot his snacks at the entrance to the valley!

Since you're so good at dodging blizzards, the Elves humbly request that you go back for his snacks. From the same initial conditions, how quickly can you make it from the start to the goal, then back to the start, then back to the goal?

In the above example, the first trip to the goal takes 18 minutes, the trip back to the start takes 23 minutes, and the trip back to the goal again takes 13 minutes, for a total time of 54 minutes.

What is the fewest number of minutes required to reach the goal, go back to the start, then reach the goal again?

Your puzzle answer was `842`.

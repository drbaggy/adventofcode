# Day 17: Pyroclastic Flow

## Solution

Perhaps the hardest one so far...

Part 1 we can solve by just dropping rocks, Part 2 we need to find a cycle - once we have that cycle we need to find it's period AND the height gain per cycle.

There are multiple ways to store the tunnel - in our case we will use a bit map per row. The base the becomes `0b1 1111 1111` and a blank row `0b1 0000 0001`, and the rocks have a bitmap representation (see `@r` below)....

At the start of the loop we remove any blank lines - we then check to see if the line matches the "base" - it it does we record the index and the height, otherwise we repeatedly move left and right (and down) till the rock can't move down any further. You will see the use of bit-shift operators `<<`, `>>`, `<<=` and '>>=' and binary and `&` to test for collisions (and binary `|` to record the location of rocks)

We repeat until we have found the horizontal line 3 times.. This gives us one complete cycle.

To get the height at "N" it is `height[ N % cycle length ] + gap * (|N/cycle length|)`

**Note** if `N % cycle length` is before the second full width line - we add cycle length to the height index and reduce the multiplier by 1....

```perl
my @in = map { $_ eq '>' ? 1 : -1 } grep {/[<>]/}split //, <>;

## Set up rock array...
my($bs,$bl,$nr,@r,@b,@h) = (511,257,0,map{my$q=$_;[map{my$p=$_;[map{$_>>$p}@{$q}]}-4..3]}
[15],[4,14,4],[2,2,14],[8,8,8,8],[12,12]);
my @t=$bs;

while( 1 ) {
  my($x,$y,$r) =( 2, 0, $r[$rn++%5] );
  pop @t while $t[-1] == $bl;
  push @h, @t-1;
  if($t[-1] == $bs) { push @b, [ $rn, scalar @t ]; last if @b==3; }
  my $count = @{$r->[0]}-1;
  push @t, $bl for -$count .. 3;
  while(++$y) {
    push @in, my $d = shift @in;
    $x+=$d unless grep { $t[-$y-$_] & $r->[$x+$d][$_] } 0 .. $count;
    map( { $t[-$y-$_] |= $r->[$x][$_] } 0..$count ), last if
      grep { $t[-$y-$_-1] & $r->[$x][$_] } 0 .. $count;
  }
}

my($d,@res) = $b[2][0]-$b[1][0];
for( 2_022, 1_000_000_000_000 ) {
  my($i,$m)=($_%$d,int($_/$d));
  ($i+=$d,$m--) if $i<$b[1][0];
  push @res, $h[$i] + $m*($b[2][1]-$b[1][1]);
}
say for @res;

## Description
Your handheld device has located an alternative exit from the cave for you and the elephants. The ground is rumbling almost continuously now, but the strange valves bought you some time. It's definitely getting warmer in here, though.

The tunnels eventually open into a very tall, narrow chamber. Large, oddly-shaped rocks are falling into the chamber from above, presumably due to all the rumbling. If you can't work out where the rocks will fall next, you might be crushed!

The five types of rocks have the following peculiar shapes, where `#` is rock and `.` is empty space:

```
####

.#.
###
.#.

..#
..#
###

#
#
#
#

##
##
```

The rocks fall in the order shown above: first the - shape, then the + shape, and so on. Once the end of the list is reached, the same order repeats: the - shape falls first, sixth, 11th, 16th, etc.

The rocks don't spin, but they do get pushed around by jets of hot gas coming out of the walls themselves. A quick scan reveals the effect the jets of hot gas will have on the rocks as they fall (your puzzle input).

For example, suppose this was the jet pattern in your cave:

`>>><<><>><<<>><>>><<<>>><<<><<<>><>><<>>`

In jet patterns, `<` means a push to the left, while `>` means a push to the right. The pattern above means that the jets will push a falling rock right, then right, then right, then left, then left, then right, and so on. If the end of the list is reached, it repeats.

The tall, vertical chamber is exactly seven units wide. Each rock appears so that its left edge is two units away from the left wall and its bottom edge is three units above the highest rock in the room (or the floor, if there isn't one).

After a rock appears, it alternates between being pushed by a jet of hot gas one unit (in the direction indicated by the next symbol in the jet pattern) and then falling one unit down. If any movement would cause any part of the rock to move into the walls, floor, or a stopped rock, the movement instead does not occur. If a downward movement would have caused a falling rock to move into the floor or an already-fallen rock, the falling rock stops where it is (having landed on something) and a new rock immediately begins falling.

Drawing falling rocks with @ and stopped rocks with `#`, the jet pattern in the example above manifests as follows:

```

To prove to the elephants your simulation is accurate, they want to know how tall the tower will get after `2022` rocks have stopped (but before the `2023`rd rock begins falling). In this example, the tower of rocks will be `3068` units tall.

How many units tall will the tower of rocks be after `2022` rocks have stopped falling?

Your puzzle answer was `3153`.

--- Part Two ---
The elephants are not impressed by your simulation. They demand to know how tall the tower will be after `1000000000000` rocks have stopped! Only then will they feel confident enough to proceed through the cave.

In the example above, the tower would be `1514285714288` units tall!

How tall will the tower be after `1000000000000` rocks have stopped?

Your puzzle answer was `1553665689155`.
